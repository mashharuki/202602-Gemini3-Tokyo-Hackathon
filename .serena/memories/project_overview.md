# Project Overview
- Repository: Gemini3 Tokyo Hackathon (2026-02-21)
- Purpose: Hackathon workspace focused on MUD-based autonomous worlds/full onchain game development.
- Primary implementation lives under `tutorial/`.
- Workspace structure: pnpm monorepo with `packages/client` (React + Vite + Three.js) and `packages/contracts` (MUD + Solidity/Foundry).
- Top-level `.kiro/specs/` and `.kiro/steering/` exist for spec-driven workflow, but currently minimal content in repo.

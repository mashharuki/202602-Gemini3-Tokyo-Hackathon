# Style and Conventions
- Language/tooling: TypeScript + React/Vite (client), Three.js (visualization), Node.js (server), Solidity + MUD (if contracts are used).
- Environment: Node >= 20, pnpm >= 9.
- Development Process: AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle) / Kiro style Spec-Driven Development.
  - Phase 1 (Spec): Define in `.kiro/specs/` (requirements, design, tasks).
  - Phase 2 (Implementation): Follow specs, keep code quality high.
- Code Quality (from AGENTS.md):
  - Think in English, output in Japanese (unless specified otherwise).
  - Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it.
  - DRY principle, meaningful names, consistent styling.
  - Handle errors properly (no silent @ts-ignore or swallowed catches) and test error cases.
  - TDD principles by t-wada (Test-Driven Development).
- Security: No hardcoded secrets (use environment variables), validate inputs, least privilege.
- Commits: Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.).
